    Requires a graphical Emacs instance to run.

Installation
------------

Install from `Marmalade <https://marmalade-repo.org/>`_ or `MELPA
(Stable) <http://melpa.org/>`_ via ``M-x package-install RET xbm-life
RET``.

Alternatively download the ``xbm-life.el`` file, open it in Emacs and
execute ``M-x eval-buffer``.

Usage
-----

Run ``M-x xbm-life`` for the demo.  You can run multiple (mostly)
independent demos along each other by either renaming an existing one
with ``M-x rename-buffer`` and running ``M-x xbm-life`` for an
additional one or by perusing ``C-u M-x xbm-life`` to give the one you
launch a different name.  The timer is global however, therefore all
spawned demos run the same speed and get paused/unpaused at the same
time.

You can get an idea of the current details of the demo by taking a
closer look at the modeline where key indicators (such as grid size,
tile size, etc.) are displayed.

Below is a list of useful keybindings for playing around.
